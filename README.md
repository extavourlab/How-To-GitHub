# How-To-GitHub
This repository holds documentation and information on how to use git and GitHub for members of the Extavour Laboratory

# Where to start

### 1) Create a GitHub account
First and foremost you will need to have a GitHub account. To create one is really easy, just head over to https://github.com/join. 
 
### 2) Get added to the GitHub repository as a member
A member of the lab must add you as a member of the repository so that you can add code, documentation, or anything else you would like to preserve on GitHub. Currently (Oct 2020) the admin members who can perform this action are: Cassandra Extavour, Leo Blondel, Sam Church and Guillem Ylla. Contact one of them to get added. 

### 3) Create and manage your repositories
You can now create your own repository, or access other projects repos as well (if they were private). 

When you create a repository, you have the option to make it public or private. A private repository is only visible by lab members and can be a good place to store your code as you move along your project. Once your project is finished, and you want to publish it, just change the settings to public !

# How to use git
To be honnest, git is a beatiful tool that is often missunderstood and very often missused and abused! Why ? Well because with those 30 minutes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc you can use git already, and save your code, stage files, collaborate with many etc. So if you have never used Git or a Version Control system, then head over there and watch it! It'll get you setup :D

BUT what those 30 minutes won't teach you is the intricacy of Git, now those are learned by experience and hard lessons, but maybe this will get you a sense of where you can get to: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SJCYPsef54

# How to add a member
For admin members that need to add members to the GitHub account, here is the procedure:

### 1) Ask for the GitHub handle
First you will need the GitHub handle of the member to be added, this is their account nickname they chose. 

### 2) Invite them to the repo
Head over to https://github.com/orgs/extavourlab/people and click on the **Invite Member** button. Then write down their GitHub handle.

Click invite and they will receive a confirmation email, where they need to accept the invitation. 

Once this is done, they now have the right to view private repository and create new ones.
